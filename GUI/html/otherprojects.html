                    <p><b>Authors:</b> José Venson, Jean Berni, Carlos Maia, Ana Marques3, Marcos d’Ornelas and Anderson Maciel</p>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> In the radiology diagnosis, medical images are most often visualized slice by slice on 2D screens or printed. At the same time, the visualization based on 3D volumetric rendering of the data is considered useful and has increased its field of application. We report a user study to assess VR usage in the diagnostic procedure of fracture identification. In addition, we assessed the subjects perception of the 3D reconstruction quality and ease of interaction.</p>

                    <br/><spam class="small">SVR 2016</spam></h3>

                    <p><b>Authors:</b> FRANZ, J., MENIN, A. and NEDEL, L.</p>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Desktop-based operating systems allow the use of many applications concurrently, but the frequent switching between two or more applications distracts the user, preventing him to keep focused in the main task. In this work we introduce an augmented mouse, which supports the regular 2D movements and clicks, as well as 3D gestures performed over it. While the keyboard and mouse conventional operation are used for the main task, with 3D gestures the user can control secondary tasks. As a proof of concept, we embedded a Leap Motion Controller device inside a regular mouse. User tests have been conducted firstly to help in the selection of the gestures supported, and then to evaluate the device effectiveness and usability. Results shown that the use of the augmented mouse as a strategy to keep the user focused reduces the task completion time.</p>

                    <br/><spam class="small">VRST 2013</spam></h3>

                    <p><b>Authors:</b> Vitor A. M. Jorge, Wilson J. Sarmiento, Anderson Maciel, Luciana Nedel, César A. Collazos, Frederico Faria, Jackson Oliveira</p>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Any human-computer interface imposes a certain level of cognitive load to the user task. Analogously, the task itself also imposes different levels of cognitive load. It is common sense in 3D user interfaces research that a higher number of degrees of freedom increases the interface cognitive load. If the cognitive load is significant,it might compromise the user performance and undermine the evaluation of user skills in a virtual environment. In this paper, we propose an assessment of two immersive VR interfaces with varying degrees of freedom in two VR tasks: risk perception and basic object selection. We examine the effectiveness of both interfaces in these two different tasks. Results show that the number of degrees of freedom does not significantly affect a basic selection task, but it affects risk perception task in an unexpected way.</p>

                    <br/><spam class="small">SAC 2013</spam></h3>

                    <p><b>Authors:</b> Juliano Franz, Anderson Maciel and Luciana Nedel</p>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> The efficient, natural and precise selection and manipulation of nearby objects in 3D environments is yet a challenge in the area of 3D interaction. Robot teleoperation is a potential application field for this kind of interaction and a difficult task. In part due to the low quality of the information delivered to the operator, but also because of the non-natural interfaces used to operate the robot. This paper presents a direct 3D user interface based on visual and haptic feedback that can be correctly operated by untrained users. The interface offers a higher level of presence than the average existing solutions, and involves the use of the operator’s primary hand to control a robotic arm using a Phantom device. Spatial awareness, in turn, is obtained from stereoscopic vision and motion parallax effect. The main contribution though is an assessment study to investigate which interface elements maximize user performance and if any interface elements is counter-effective. Surprising results show that parallax is the most effective feature while stereoscopy is often detrimental and force feedback requires training. </p>

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> The evolution of graphics hardware in the past decade has made it possible to generate scenes in computer games with a high degree of realism, which in turn, requires richer interactions. However, while the number and complexity of possible interactive tasks increases, the motor capabilities of humans remains almost constant. One solution for this issue is to use other communication strategies. In this paper, we explore the foot as an interaction channel and demonstrate its viability to accomplish different tasks. We also show that interaction using the foot can be easily and efficiently implemented under different hardware configurations. To validate our hypothesis, we present results of three experiments involving different hardware and software configurations, and summarize the lessons learned and discuss potential avenues to continue this work.</p>

                    <br/><spam class="small">SVR 2009</spam></h3>

                    <p><b>Authors:</b> Henrique G. Debarba, Jerônimo G. Grandi, Adriano Oliveski, Diana Domingues, Anderson Maciel and Luciana P. Nedel</p>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Trans-sensory perception is the alternative use of one of our senses to perceive information which is generally perceived by another sense. Common examples exist among handicapped people, such as blind people who play soccer based on sound emitters placed on the ball and at the goals. The present study aims at using wind as an interface modality for interaction in virtual environments. More than that, in this study we propose to use the direction of the air in motion as an abstraction of the natural sense humans have from the wind. We give a new meaning to the wind direction with the purpose of self-orientation in virtual reality environments. We develop hardware and software interfaces for wind rendering and then analyze user performance on specific orientation tasks.</p>
